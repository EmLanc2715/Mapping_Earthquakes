# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days. The maps also illustrate earthquake data in relation to tectonic plates' location. Earthquakes with a maginiude of 4.5 or higher are displayed; you can hover over an earthquake and the magnitude and location will be displayed in a pop-up marker.

## Earthquake Challenge Maps
The three different map styles are shown below.
